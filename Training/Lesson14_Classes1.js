Homework: Create an `Employee` Class (No Inheritance)

ðŸš€ Objective:
Create a JavaScript class named `Employee` that represents an employee with strict validation rules 
and meaningful output using getters and methods.

âœ… Properties:
Your class should have the following properties, all validated via setters:

1. name (String):
   - Must be between 2 and 15 characters.
   - Must be a string.
   - Normalized: first letter uppercase, the rest lowercase.

2. surname (String):
   - Same validation rules and normalization as name.

3. email (String):
   - Must follow the basic format: x.x@xx.
   - Should be trimmed (no leading/trailing spaces).
   - Must be converted to lowercase.

4. phoneNumber (String):
   - Must be a string.
   - Must be exactly 9 digits.
   - Must start with one of the valid Armenian mobile prefixes: 
     091, 093, 094, 095, 096, 097, 098, or 099.
   - No extra characters allowed (only digits, no "+" or dashes).

5. position (String):
   - Must be between 2 and 50 characters.

6. salary (Number):
   - Must be a number.
   - Must be greater than or equal to 68,000 AMD (minimum net salary in Armenia).

7. isRemote (Boolean):
   - Must be either true or false.

All values must be assigned through their respective setters during object construction. 
If any validation fails, throw an Error with a descriptive message.

ðŸ“¤ Getter:
Create a getter named `info` that returns a complete summary of the employee:

Example:
"Employee information: Bob Henderson is a QA Automation Engineer. He works remotely. 
His salary is 670000 AMD. Phone number: 098666666. 
Email: bob.henderson@email.com"

- If `isRemote` is false, the sentence should say: "He works on-site."

ðŸ”§ Methods:

1. giveRaise(amount):
   - Increases the salary by the given amount (number).
   - Validates that the input is a number.

2. raiseSalary(percent):
   - Increases the employeeâ€™s current salary by the given percent.
   - The percent input:
     - Must be a number.
     - Must be greater than 0.
   - Throws an error if input is invalid.

3. changePosition(newPosition):
   - Changes the employeeâ€™s position to the given value.
   - Validation rules:
     - Must be a string.
     - Must be between 2 and 50 characters.
   - Throws an error if the input is invalid.
